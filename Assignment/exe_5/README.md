# Quantized Machine Learning Assignment

This project demonstrates how to apply dynamic quantization techniques to a logistic regression model using PyTorch, as part of a machine learning lab assignment.

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to:
- Load and preprocess the MNIST or Digits dataset.
- Train a logistic regression model using PyTorch.
- Apply dynamic quantization to the model.
- Compare the performance of the original and quantized models.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python 3.8+ and the following packages installed:

- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`

You can install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
